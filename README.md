# Aim:Study of Dictionary in Python
# Theory:
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates. Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, where the key acts as a unique identifier for its associated value. Because keys must be unique, providing a duplicate key will simply overwrite the existing value.
To manage this data, you can use the len() function to find the total number of pairs, or use .keys() and .values() to view the specific labels and data stored within. For safe data retrieval, the .get() method is used to access a value without risking a crash if the key is missing, while the .pop() method allows you to remove and return a specific item. If the dictionary contains numerical values, you can even use max() to find the highest value or key.
